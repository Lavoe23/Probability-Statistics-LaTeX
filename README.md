# Probability & Stochastic Modeling Reports

A collection of technical analysis reports demonstrating rigorous mathematical modeling of stochastic processes, reliability engineering, and statistical inference. 

These projects showcase the application of probability theory to solve complex engineering and business problems, documented with professional typographic standards using **LaTeX**.

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized into specific domains of probabilistic analysis:

### 1. Reliability Engineering & System Failure (`/Reliability_Models`)
Mathematical modeling of system lifespans and failure rates.
* **System Topology Analysis:** Calculation of failure probabilities in Series, Parallel, and Mixed circuit configurations.
* **Exponential Mixtures:** Modeling component longevity using Continuous Random Variables.
* **Game Theory Application:** Decision-making analysis based on Expected Value ($E[X]$) optimization.

### 2. Stochastic Distributions & Quality Control (`/Stochastic_Distributions`)
Application of continuous distributions to industrial and financial scenarios.
* **Normal Distribution Analysis:** Use of Standardized variables ($Z$-scores) for quality assurance and defect probability estimation.
* **Conditional Probability:** Application of Bayes' Theorem and Total Probability Theorem in dependent events.
* **Stochastic Processes:** Modeling mixed discrete-continuous experiments (e.g., iterative Bernoulli trials).

## Usage & Compilation

Each project folder contains the source code (`.tex`) and the compiled binary (`.pdf`) for direct viewing.

To build the reports from source locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Probability-Statistics-LaTeX.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Probability-Statistics-LaTeX.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a report directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Probability-Statistics-LaTeX/Reliability_Models
    ```
3.  **Compile using pdfLaTeX:**
    ```bash
    pdflatex informe.tex
    ```
